## HelloWorld PHP Extension

A simple PHP extension that demonstrates basic "Hello World" functionality.

## Run

1. Compile the extension:

    ```
    phpize
    ./configure
    make
    ```

2. Run

    ```
    % php -d extension=./modules/helloworld.so -i | grep hello

    helloworld
    helloworld support => enabled

    % php -d extension=./modules/helloworld.so smoke.php
    Hello World!
   ```

### Basic Function

```php
<?php
helloworld();
// Output: Hello World!
```

# Getting started with development

This guide is intended to help complete beginners with no knowledge or experience of C or PECL to take their first steps.

## Edit, Build and Run

After cloning, edit `hellworld.c` to change the message.

```c
php_printf("Hello World!\n");
```

Next, compile to build.

```
phpize
./configure
make
```

This will create `modules/helloworld.so`. Now let's give it a try!

```
php -d extension=./modules/helloworld.so smoke.php
```

When your message is displayed in the hellworld() function, you are done!ðŸŽ‰

## What next?

Change the two strings `helloworld` and `HELLOWORLD` to suit your project. Change the function names too.

The world of PECL development is vast and there is a lot to learn, but if you can get past the environment building barrier, you are already one step ahead.
Take on the challenge of PECL development from here onwards!

## Continuous Integration

This project contains a GitHub action workflow file.
Make sure the project is built successfully by ushing it; CI also installs Valgrind and checks for memory leaks.

## IDE

This repository contains CmakeLists.txt, which Clion needs to understand the source code.
Development using an IDE is efficient and allows for debugging, including a backtrace.
